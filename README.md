# ToolStorePy

**ToolStorePy** is an automatic **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server builder**.

Describe the tools you need in plain English. ToolStorePy finds the best matching implementations from a curated vector index, clones the repositories, audits them for security issues, and generates a single runnable MCP server — all in one command.

---

## ✨ What It Does

Given a `queries.json` file describing the tools you need:

```json
[
  { "tool_description": "evaluate a mathematical arithmetic expression securely" },
  { "tool_description": "convert between different units of measurement" },
  { "tool_description": "calculate cryptographic hash of a file" }
]
```

ToolStorePy will:

1. Resolve and download a vector index of curated tool repositories
2. Run semantic search + cross-encoder reranking to find the best tool per query
3. Clone matched repositories (served from a local bare-repo cache for speed)
4. Run a static AST security scan on every cloned repo
5. Show you a full security report and let you approve or skip flagged repos
6. Scan for `.env.example` files and merge them into a single `workspace/.env.example`
7. Validate your existing `workspace/.env` against required secrets if one exists
8. Parse `@tool`-decorated functions via AST and synthesise a unified MCP server
9. Print run commands and ask whether to launch the server immediately

**Output:**

```

├── .env.example            # merged secrets template (if any repos need secrets)
└── .venv/                  # isolated Python environment with MCP installed
```

## 📦 Installation

### Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.12
- Git installed and on `PATH`
- Internet access (for index download + repo cloning)

### Install

```bash
pip install .
```

Or in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Command

```bash
toolstorepy build \
  --queries queries.json \
  --index-url https://your-index-url.zip
```

Or using a built-in named index:

```bash
toolstorepy build \
  --queries queries.json \
  --index core-tools
```

---

## ⚙️ CLI Reference

### `build`

```bash
toolstorepy build --queries <path> [--index <name> | --index-url <url>] [options]
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--queries` | Path to `queries.json` (required) |
| `--index` | Name of a built-in tool index |
| `--index-url` | Direct URL to a downloadable index archive (.zip or .tar.gz) |
| `--workspace` | Workspace directory (default: `toolstorepy_workspace`) |
| `--install-requirements` | Install `requirements.txt` from each cloned repo into the workspace venv |
| `--force-refresh` | Re-download the index archive even if cached |
| `--verbose` | Enable verbose logging |

### `cache`

```bash
toolstorepy cache populate --queries <path> [--force]
toolstorepy cache list
toolstorepy cache clear
```

| Subcommand | Description |
|---|---|
| `populate` | Pre-cache repos from a `queries.json` without building |
| `list` | List all locally cached repositories |
| `clear` | Delete all cached repositories |

---

## 🔐 Security Scanning

Before building, ToolStorePy runs a static AST scan on every cloned repository and produces a report covering:

| Severity | What is checked |
|---|---|
| 🔴 HIGH | Shell/subprocess execution, `eval`/`exec`, outbound network requests, unsafe deserialisation (`pickle`, `yaml.load`) |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | File I/O, environment variable access, reflection (`getattr`, `setattr`, `globals`), insecure XML parsers |
| 🟢 LOW | Direct crypto primitives, deprecated modules, potential secret logging |

The full report is printed to the terminal and saved to `workspace/security_report.txt`.

For any repo with **HIGH** findings, you are asked individually whether to include it in the build or skip it. Skipped repos are excluded from the generated server and noted in a comment block at the top of `mcp_unified_server.py`.

---

## 🔑 Secret Management

If any cloned repo contains a `.env.example` file, ToolStorePy will:

- Merge all `.env.example` files into a single `workspace/.env.example`, grouped by repo with attribution comments
- Prompt you interactively to resolve any key conflicts (same key defined in multiple repos)
- Check your existing `workspace/.env` against the merged template and warn about any missing or empty keys
- List all required environment variables in both the terminal output and as a comment block at the top of `mcp_unified_server.py`

Prompt: run now or run manually?
```

### Models

| Role | Default model |
|---|---|
| Embedding | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` |
| Reranking | `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` |

Both can be overridden when instantiating `ToolStorePy` directly.

---

## ⚡ Repo Cache

Repositories are cloned once as bare repos into `~/.repo_cache` and reused across all future builds. This makes repeated builds near-instant.

```bash
# Pre-populate cache before a build
toolstorepy cache populate --queries queries.json

# See what's cached
toolstorepy cache list

# Wipe cache
toolstorepy cache clear
```

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Suite

ToolStorePy includes two evaluation scripts in `testing/`:

### `eval_RAG_Rerank.py`

Benchmarks retrieval + reranking accuracy across five query perturbation variants:

| Variant | What it does |
|---|---|
| `original` | Unmodified queries |
| `remove_token` | One random token removed per query |
| `add_token` | One random filler word inserted |
| `add_char` | One random character inserted into a token |
| `synonym` | A noun replaced with a synonym |

Produces 6 CSV reports + a summary including per-variant accuracy, robustness deltas, rerank score distributions, and flip analysis.

### `eval_build.py`

Stress-tests the full build pipeline in parallel across many tool subsets. Measures:

- Build success rate
- AST validity of generated servers
- Tool count per build
- Build timing (avg / median / min / max)

All broken down by subset size.

## 📦 Installation

### Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.12
- Git installed and on `PATH`
- Internet access (for index download + repo cloning)

### Install

```bash
pip install .
```

Or in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Note on `mcp[cli]`

ToolStorePy deliberately does **not** install `mcp[cli]` into your system Python environment. Instead, it creates an isolated virtual environment at `toolstorepy_workspace/.venv` and installs `mcp[cli]` there automatically during the first build. This keeps the MCP runtime sandboxed alongside the generated server and avoids version conflicts with anything else in your environment. You do not need to install `mcp` manually — the build step handles it.
