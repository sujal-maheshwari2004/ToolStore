  1,calculator,This is a secure mathematical calculator designed to evaluate a text-based arithmetic expression. It supports standard operations like addition\, subtraction\, multiplication\, division\, and exponents on both integer and floating-point numbers within a sandboxed environment.,https://github.com/rahulsingh0327/calculator.git
  2,unit converter,This tool is a flexible unit converter capable of handling different categories of measurement. It supports conversions for length units (e.g.\, meters\, feet) and temperature units (Celsius\, Fahrenheit\, Kelvin)\, requiring the input value\, original unit\, and target unit.,https://github.com/rahulsingh0327/unit_converter.git
  3,notes,This is a notes management tool that supports basic CRUD (Create\, Read\, Update\, Delete)-like operations. Users can create new notes (with a title and body)\, list all stored notes\, or retrieve a single note using its unique numeric ID.,https://github.com/rahulsingh0327/notes.git
  4,system monitor,A system monitoring tool that provides insight into the host environment. It can deliver a system summary (a snapshot of CPU\, memory\, and disk usage) or list the top n running processes ranked by their memory consumption. Requires the psutil library.,https://github.com/rahulsingh0327/system_monitor.git
  5,Weather,This service fetches the current weather conditions for a specified city. It returns a summary including temperature (in Celsius)\, humidity\, and a textual condition. It supports various providers\, such as OpenWeatherMap\, which may require an api_key,https://github.com/rahulsingh0327/weather_tool.git
  6,Currency,This tool facilitates financial conversions\, taking a numeric amount and converting it between two specified ISO currency codes (e.g.\, USD to INR) using live exchange rates\, defaulting to the exchangerate.host provider.,https://github.com/rahulsingh0327/currency_tool.git
  7,Text,A lightweight tool for simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks on input text. It can perform a word or character count\, generate a brief summary of the text\, or extract the top n keywords from the content.,https://github.com/rahulsingh0327/text_tool.git
  8,Random,This tool is designed to generate various types of random data\, useful for testing or security. It can generate UUIDs\, cryptographic tokens or hex strings (by length in bytes)\, or a random integer within a specified upper bound.,https://github.com/rahulsingh0327/random_tool.git
  9,Docker,This is a read-only Docker management tool. Its functions include listing all currently running containers and fetching the logs for a specified container. It's noted for safety as it performs no destructive operations and requires access to the Docker daemon.,https://github.com/rahulsingh0327/docker_tool.git
  10,git,This tool interacts with a local Git repository. It can retrieve the current repository status (e.g.\, untracked or modified files) or show the commit log history\, allowing a limit (n) on the number of commits returned.,https://github.com/rahulsingh0327/git_tool.git
  11,Network,This is a network diagnostic tool. It supports two functions: ping a host or IP address (with an optional packet count) to check connectivity\, or perform a DNS lookup to resolve a domain name.,https://github.com/rahulsingh0327/network_tool.git
  12,hash,This tool provides essential utilities for data encoding and integrity. It can calculate the cryptographic hash of a file (supporting an optional algorithm) or perform Base64 encoding and decoding operations on text data.,https://github.com/rahulsingh0327/hash_tool.git
  13,Image meta,This tool is designed to read and return detailed metadata for a local image file. The output dictionary includes key information such as the image format\, its dimensions (width and height)\, and any embedded EXIF data.,https://github.com/rahulsingh0327/image_meta_tool.git
  14,CSV Excel,This helper tool works with local CSV and XLSX (Excel) files. It offers two main actions: a data preview (returning the first n rows) or generating summary statistics (providing the total count of rows and columns). It utilizes the pandas library.,https://github.com/rahulsingh0327/csv_excel_tool.git
  15,PDF,This tool is a PDF utility for handling local files. It can either extract the full text content from the document (up to a specified max_pages) or retrieve metadata like the total page count. Requires the PyPDF2 library.,https://github.com/rahulsingh0327/pdf_tool.git
